## Usage

Once the website is deployed, you will see my full name and current photo on the top of the page. In the navigation bar, there are links to about me, my work and how to contact me. When you click on one of those links, the UI will scrolls to the corresponding section. When you click on the link to the section about my work, you will be presented with titled images of my applications. When you click on the image of the application, you will be taken to that deployed application. Finally, when you resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, you will be presented with a responsive layout, you will see that text, pictures, links, sections' disposition will change.

## Learning Points 

- Structure an HTML file to follow logic order.
- Difference between semantic and non semantic HTML elements.
- HTML block vs HTML inline elements
- Classes vs IDs to indicate that a css style will be applied to multiple HTML elements vs a single element.
- Chrome Developer Tools to debug my web designs.
- Flexbox and grid for responsive layouts.
- Transitions for animating the user interface.
- Image color filtering.
- Media Query for Screen to design attractive webpages that are accessible from any platform.
- box-sizing to tell the browser to account for any border and padding in the values you specify for an element's width and height.
- Box-styling using the transform css property with rotate, scale and skew values to change the shape of a box.
- border-radius to round box corners and box-shadow to give a 3D look to a box.
- Use reset.css to create a clean starting point and minimize cross-browser differencies.
- Pseudo-classes style the different states of an element.
- Pseudo-Elements style a specific part of the selected element(s).
- variables to store repeated css values.
